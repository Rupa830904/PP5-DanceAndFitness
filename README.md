### Surface<hr>
#### Color Scheme
All the colours were selected generated from the hero image using Coolors
<img src="media/colorpalette.png" width="60%"><br>

#### Fonts
* The fonts I used for this site were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/):<br>
**Body:** *Alice, serif*<br>
**Logo:** *Yesteryear, cursive*<br>
**Custom error page:** *Josefin Sans, sans-serif*

## Business Model

* The business model chosen for this project is <b>Business to Customer</b>, as the main purpose of the website is to deliver final products to customers. This model was implemented using an interactive, attractive and intuitive interface that gives the clients an upgraded experience for shopping.<br><br>
<img src="media/b2c_diagram.png" width="60%">

* The online bakeshop offers a diverse selections of baked products categorised as *All Products*, *Cakes*(Cakes are further sub-categorised to drip cakes, buttercream cakes, chocolate cakes and occassion cakes), *Desserts*, *Sweet Treats* and *Everyday Esssentials*. Customers can order any quantity of the products within the limit of available stock.
* The bakeshop also have a Cork Bakeshop Cafe, where customers/clients can relax and enjoy their favourite sweet treats with a cold or hot beverage of their choice. They also have an option to purchase all their favourites as the cafe stock all the bakeshop products on site. 

## Marketing

### Facebook Page
* The marketing strategy includes a Facebook business page that is intended to create a good image of the bakeshop by posting news and promotions available. By highly promoting the products and always adding new content, the page will increase its popularity and attract more and more customers to buy from the online store. The page can be accessed at [this link](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61553025716191).<br><br><br>
*Note, this link may be broken as facebook regularly deletes inactive business pages.
<img width="80%" src="media/facebook_screenshot.png">

### Newsletter
* Newsletter is also utilised as a marketing strategy in an attempt to improve customer engagement further, keeping them up to date and also incentivising them by running promotions on regular basis.<br><br>
<img width="60%" src="media/newsletter_screenshot.png">

## Search Engine Optimisation

I have created a sitemap and robots.txt file to help aid search engines locate the site. To keep user's information safe, any pages that could contain sensitive information has been disallowed in the robots.txt.

The purpose of the About Us page was not so much designed in mind to inform the user, but more so to have an opportunity to use some keywords, and link the user to any other relevant website, all to help boost the site's ranking in search engine results.

The initial keywords and phrases I came up with were:<br>
### Short Tail Keywords
 * Cakes Cork
 * cork bakeshop
 * sweet treats
 * desserts
 * wedding cakes
 * occasion cakes
 * birthday cakes
 * pies
 * doughnuts
 * drip cakes
 * chocolate cakes
 * elegant cakes
 * christening cake <br>

### Long Tail Keywords
 * scrumptious cakes
 * shop cakes online
 * cake delivery in cork
 * custom-made cakes

## Agile Methodology
This project was developed utilising the Agile Methodogy.<br>
 I prioritized features by labeling them such as "must-have", "could-have", "future enhancement", "backlog" and "bugs" among others and moved some less critical ones to future development. To guide my development process, I created user stories for both the admin/staff user and guests/clients/customers. These stories helped to define the features and functionalities that were most important to project's target audience.

As a student solo developer who was learning a lot during development, I faced challenges in estimating the time required for each task and only had a basic concept of what I would be able to create at a given timeframe. Therefore, I kept things simple and focused on achievable goals. Aiming for Minimum Viable Product, or MVP. All the features and functionalities that I wanted to have but I didn't manage to finish because of time constraints were moved to "Future Enhancement". With the goal of implementing them on the projects future release.

To keep track of progress, I used Github Projects(https://github.com/users/Aylamccarthy/projects/5). I used a kanban board (https://github.com/users/Aylamccarthy/projects/5/views/1?layout=board) divided into following sections: "to do", "in progress" "done", "backlog", "future enhancements" and "bugs" that allowed me to visualize all tasks and prioritize next steps. However, I could not find the "epics" feature in GitHub Projects, only milestones (it provides only [milestones and issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues)). Epics are supposed to be larger in scope than milestones, representing a significant amount of work. Milestones, on the other hand, are meant to mark significant points in time in terms of project completion. In this document, I added epics, but on the project board, I used only [milestones]() to stay in order with GitHub's features.

By using Agile methodology, I was able to stay organized, work efficiently and focused on delivering the most important features, while also allowing flexibility for future development. This experience gave me invaluable insight and lessons that I can apply to future projects.

<img src="media/update_review.png" width="40%"><br><br>

#### Wishlist
* On the *Product Details* page there is an interactive feature that is only available for logged-in users that are not staff members. A user has the possibility to add a product to the wishlist through a form that uses a heart icon as a button. The heart shape defines the state of the product in the wishlist database. This feature is also accessible on the *Bag* page.<br><br>
<img src="media/add_wishlist.png" width="30%"><br><br>
<img src="media/remove_wishlist.png" width="30%"><br><br>

* In the *Wishlist* page there are listed all the favourite items of the user with a design similar to the one created for the *Products* pages. A filtering and sorting section is also available and every element is linked to a *Product Details* page.<br>
An additional feature would be that every item includes a representation of the number of times it has been added to the wishlist by all the users.<br><br>
<img src="media/wishlist.png" width="90%"><br><br>

#### Bag
* A feature for adding a product to the shopping bag has been created and included in the *Products*, *Product Details* and *Wishlist* pages. This is a form for updating the products existing in the shopping bag and also their quantity.
* In the *Bag* page there's a list of the added items with details about quantity and price. Any item can be removed by clicking on the bin icon and also the quantity can be updated.<br><br>
<img src="media/bag_list.png"><br><br>

* A section for applying a voucher code has been implemented. Whenever a user registers on the website, an email with a 20% discount voucher code is sent automatically to the user via email. The code can be used in the shopping bag for a 20% discount. The voucher can be applied and also removed before proceeding to checkout. The code can be used only be used once by the account holder.<br>
When the order total cost doesn't reach the value specified (â‚¬50) on the website for *free delivery*, a message will be displayed to inform the user about the remaining value to be added to be able to avail of free delivery service (calculated as 10% from the order total).<br><br>

<img src="media/voucher1.png" width="40%"><br><br>

#### Checkout
* The *Checkout* page represents the final step in completing the order.<br>
A form for personal, delivery and payment details is displayed for the user to fill in with valid data. As the delivery is available only for Cork - Ireland, the fields *Country, County and City* are filled by default with values and can't be edited by the user from the interface. Additionally, a validation has been implemented to not allow other values to be submitted. The form has validation for the phone number field as well to match an Ireland format. The payment input has its own Stripe-implemented validation.<br><br>
<img src="media/checkout_page.png" width="80%"><br><br>
* An order summary is displayed with details about the products and cost.
* After the order is completed, the user is sent to a *Checkout Success * page with full specifications and details.

#### Payment
* Underneath the delivery details is the card payment box which is run by Stripe.
* Only numbers can be entered into the card payment box. Incorrect card numbers will automatically show an 
  invalid card number error.
* The site can be tested by using the dummy card number 4242 4242 4242 4242 with the expiry date 04/24 and the CVC code 242.
* At the end of the section is a button to complete the order or to return back to the bag. There is also a warning message informing the user of how much their card is about to be charged.<br><br>
<img src="media/stripe_payment.png" width="60%"><br><br>

#### Loading Spinner
* Upon clicking the complete order button, as long as the form is valid, a loading spinner will render until the information is processed completely.<br><br>
<img src="media/loading_spinner.png" width="40%"><br><br>

[Back to top â‡§](#overview)
#### Webhooks
* Using the Stripe website, webhooks have been set up to confirm an order goes through after payment.
* Once an order is placed, a webhook will search the database to confirm the order exists. If it cannot find the  original order, it will create one using the information provided by the user in the original instance.<br><br>
<img src="media/webhook.png" width="40%"><br><br>

#### About Us

<img src="media/toasts.png" width="40%"><br><br>

### Future Feature Considerations<hr>

* Because of increasing demand for bespoke wedding cakes, the bakeshop will implement a dedicated page specifically for wedding cakes and wedding related products. This feature will include a gallery of all the wedding cakes, customer testimonials, and a request a quote/call back form that the customers can fill out and send. This feature was planned to be implemented for this project but couldn't be done because of time constraints. It is also visible on the *Github Project* kanban board where iit is labelled as *could have* and *enhancement*.
* Implementing a chat feature for communication between customers and staff members. This would be useful for any client that has an issue on the website and also will create a better and faster way of finding solutions. 

* Creating a feature for easily sending email advertisement to the customers. This would be a default template form to be filled and the email will be automatically sent to the customers. 

* Expanding the voucher feature by implementing a points reward system for loyal customers that shop frequently from the website. The customer will be rewarded points for every purchase, which they can convert into a voucher that can be redeem with their purchases.

## Testing
The comprehensive testing documentation can be found here [TESTING.MD](TESTING.MD)

## Deployment

The app was deployed to heroku for the first time as soon as  django 
installation was completed to make sure that everything is working correctly.

## Database (ElephangSQL)

1. Navitate to [ElephantSQL website](https://www.elephantsql.com/), log in to your account
2. In top-right corner click on green button "Create New Instance".
3. Enter database name, leave plan field as is, optionaly enter tags.
4. Select region, click on "Review" and then on "Create instance".
5. Go to your dashboard, find newly created database instance, click on it.
6. Copy URL starting with "postgress://"
7. Paste this URL into env.py file as DATABASE_URL value and save the file.

  ```python
  os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "postgres://yourLinkFromDatabaseDashboard"
  ```

## AWS

Amazon web services are used to store all static and media files. 

#### S3
1. First you will need to sign up to AWS which you can do [here](https://aws.amazon.com/).
2. Once you have created an account and logged in, under the All Services>Storage menu, click the link that says S3.
3. On the S3 page you will need to create a new bucket. To do this click the orange button that says 'Create Bucket'.
4. Name the bucket and select the closest region to you. To keep things simple I recommend naming the bucket after your project's name.
5. Under 'Object Ownership' select 'ACLs enabled' and leave the Object Ownership as Bucket owner preferred. 
6. Uncheck the 'Block all public access' checkbox and check the warning box to acknowledge that the bucket will be made public, then click create bucket. 
7. Once created, click the bucket's name and navigate to the properties tab. Scroll to the bottom and under 'Static website hosting' click 'edit' and change the Static website hosting option to 'enabled'. Copy the default values for the index and error documents and click 'save changes'.
8. Now navigate to the permissions tab, scroll down to the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) section, click edit and paste in the following code:  
    ```
    [
        {
            "AllowedHeaders": [
            "Authorization"
            ],
            "AllowedMethods": [
            "GET"
            ],
            "AllowedOrigins": [
            "*"
            ],
            "ExposeHeaders": []
        }
    ]
    ```
9. Then scroll back up to the 'Bucket Policy' section. Click 'edit' and then 'Policy generator'. This should open the AWS policy generator page.
10. From here under the 'select type of policy' dropdown menu, select 'S3 Bucket Policy'. Then inside 'Principle' allow all principals by typing a *.
11. From the 'Actions dropdown menu select 'Get object'. Then head back to the previous tab and locate the Bucket ARN number. Copy that, return to the policy generator and paste it in the field labelled Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
12. Once that's completed click 'Add statement', then 'Generate Policy'. Copy the policy that's been generated and paste it into the bucket policy editor.
13. Before you click save, add a '/*' at the end of your resource key. This is to allow access to all resources in this bucket.
14. Once those changes are saved, scroll down to the Access control list (ACL) section and click 'edit'.
15. Next to 'Everyone (public access)', check the 'list' checkbox. This will pop up a warning box that you will also have to check. Once that's done click 'save'. 



## Django secret key

In order to protect django app secret key it was set as anviroment variable and stored in env.py. Please change your password accordingly.

```python
os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "yourSecretKey"
```

### Deploy on Heroku

## Heroku

1. Navigate to [https://heroku.com/](https://heroku.com/) login to your account and open dashboard. Click button "New" and select "Create new app" button.

2. Enter app name, I used "madisons-patisserie", chose your region and click on "Create app" button.

3. Click on newly created app and go to "Deploy" tab and then to "Deployment method" section. Authorize and connect your GitHub account, then find and select your repository.

4. Go to the "Settings" tab, click on "Reveal Config Vars" and add the following keys and values (all values should be strings without any quotation marks):

NOTE: DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC variable should be set to "1" for initial deployment. Before final deployment it should be removed.

    | Key                    | Value                                                            |
    |------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID      | aws url beginning with aws://                      |
    | DATABASE_URL           | postgress url beginning with postgress://                        |
    | DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC  | 1                                                                |
    | PORT                   | 8000                                                             |
    | SECRET_KEY             | YourSecretKey, the same as in env.py                             |


5. Return to your Gitpod workspace and navigate to the file `madisons_patisserie.settings.py`. Change allowed hosts including the name of the app that you created in previous steps. In my case, it was 'madisons-patisserie-8790c4325233.herokuapp.com/'. Save the file.

6. Procfile required to run project on Heroku was already created but if you change your app's name please make sure that this change is reflected in Procfile. It can be found in your project's main directory. In my case Procfile looks as below:

    ```python
    web: gunicorn madisons_patisserie.wsgi:application
    ```

7. After adding enviromental variables and editing Procfile project is ready for deployment. In Heroku app's dashboard navigate to "Deploy" tab, scroll down to "Manual deploy" section. Select main branch from dropdown menu and click on "Deploy Branch".

8. **Step required for final deployment:** Navigate again to app's settings, reveal config vars and delete DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC entry if it was set before.

9. After build is done, you should be able to see the button with the link leading to deployed app. In my case [https://madisons-patisserie-8790c4325233.herokuapp.com/](https://madisons-patisserie-8790c4325233.herokuapp.com/).

15. Next to 'Everyone (public access)', check the 'list' checkbox. This will pop up a warning box that you will also have to check. Once that's done click 'save'. 

#### IAM

1. Now that your bucket is ready we need to create a user to access it. In the search bar at the top of the window, search for IAM and select it.
2. Once on the IAM page, click 'User Groups' from the side bar, then click 'Create group'.
3. Name the group 'manage-*your-project-name*' and click 'Create group' at the bottom of the page. 
4. Then from the sidebar click 'Policies', then 'Create policy'.
5. Go to the JSON tab and click 'import managed policy'. Search for 'S3' and select 'AmazonS3FullAccess' and click import.
6. Once this is imported you will need to edit it slightly. Go back to your bucket and copy your ARN number. Head back to this policy and update the Resource key to include your ARN, and another line with your ARN followed by a /*. It should end up looking something like this: 
    ```
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "s3:*",
                    "s3-object-lambda:*"
                ],
                "Resource": [
                    "YOUR-ARN-NO-HERE",
                    "YOUR-ARN-NO-HERE/*"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
7. Click 'Next: Tags', 'Next: Review', and on this page give the policy a name. This could be something as simple as the project name followed by the word policy, and then a short description eg: Access to S3 bucket for 'YOUR PROJECT' static files. Then click 'Create policy'. 
8. This will take you back to the policy page where you should be able to see your newly created policy. Now we need to attach it to the group we created.  
9. Click 'User groups', and click the group you created earlier. Go to the permissions tab and click 'Add permission' and from the dropdown click 'Attach policies'. 
10. Find the policy you just created, select it and click 'Add permissions'.
11. Finally you need to create a user to put in the group. Select users from the sidebar and click 'Add user'.  
12. Give your user a user name, check 'Programmatic Access', then click 'Next: Permissions'. 
13. Select your group that has the policy attached and click 'Next: Tags', 'Next: Review', then 'Create user'.
14. On the next page, download the CSV file. This contains the user's access key and secret access key which you will need later.

#### Connecting AWS to django

Now that you have created a S3 bucket with its user group attached, we need to connect it to django.

1. First you will need to install two packages. Boto3 and Django storages. Do this by running these commands:  
    ```
    pip3 install boto3
    pip3 install django-storages
    ```
    And remember to freeze the requirements with:  
    ```
    pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
2. You will then need to add 'storages' to your installed apps section inside your settings.py file. Do that now. 
3. Next, we will need to add some additional settings to the same file to let django know what bucket it's communicating with. 
4. Somewhere near the bottom of the file you should write an if statement to check if there is an environment variable called USE_AWS. This variable does not exist yet but we will add it later. Inside the if statement, write the following settings so it looks like this:  
    ```
    if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
        AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'insert-your-bucket-name-here'
        AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'insert-your-region-here'
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
    ```
5. Next, hop back to heroku and in the settings tab, under config vars, you will need to add some keys with values that were downloaded earlier in the CSV file.
6. Add the key, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID with the value that was generated in the CSV file earlier. Then add the key AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and again add the value that was generated in the CSV file. Once they have both been added, add the key USE_AWS, and set the value to True.
7. You can now also remove the DISABLE_COLLECTSTAIC variable, since django should now collect static files automatically and upload them to S3.
8. Now head back to the settings.py file in your django project and head back to the if statement we wrote earlier and inside the statement add this line setting:  
    ```
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'
    ```
    This is to tell django where our static files will be coming from in production.
9. Next we need to create a file to tell django that we want to use S3 to store our static files whenever someone runs collectstatic and also that we want any uploaded product images to go there also.
10. In the root directory of your project create a file called 'custom_storages.py'. Inside this file you will need to import your settings as well as the s3boto3 storage class. So at the top of the file insert the code:  
    ```
    from django.conf import settings
    from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage
    ```
11. Then underneath the imports insert these two classes:  
    ```
    class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
        location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION


    class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
        location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
    ```
    The STATICFILES_LOCATION and MEDIAFILES_LOCATION have yet to be defined, so lets do that now.
12. Back in the settings.py file, underneath the bucket config settings but still inside the if statement, add these lines:  
    ```
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
    STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
    MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'
    ```
13. Next, you will also need to override and explicitly set the URLs for static and media files using your custom domain and new locations. To do this add these two lines inside the same if statement:  
    ```
    STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
    MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
    ```
14. If you now save, add, commit and push your changes, you should see that your S3 bucket now has a static folder with all your static files inside. Next, we need to handle the Media files but first, inside the if statement add the following code. This helps to speed things up by letting the browser know that its ok to cache static files for a long time:    
    ```
    AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
        'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
        'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
    }
    ```
15. Back in S3, go to your bucket and click 'Create folder'. Name the folder 'media' and click 'Save'. 
16. Inside the new media folder you just created, click 'Upload', 'Add files', and then select all the images that you are using on your site.
17. Then under 'Permissions' select the option 'Grant public-read access' and click upload. You may need to also check an acknowledgment warning checkbox too. 
18. Once that is finished you're all set. All your static files and media files should be automatically linked from django to your S3 bucket.

### Stripe

Stripe is needed to handle the checkout process when a payment is made. You will need a stripe account which you can sign up for [here](https://stripe.com/en-gb).

#### Payments

1. To set up stripe payments you can follow their guide [here](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment#web-collect-card-details).

#### Webhooks

1. To set up a webhook, sign into your stripe account and click 'Developers' located in the top right of the navbar.
2. Then in the side-nav under the Developers title, click on 'Webhooks', then 'Add endpoint'.
3. On the next page you will need to input the link to your heroku app followed by /checkout/wh/. It should look something like this:  
    ```
    https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/
    ```
4. Then click '+ Select events' and check the 'Select all events' checkbox at the top before clicking 'Add events' at the bottom. Once this is done finish the form by clicking 'Add endpoint'.
5. Your webhook is now created and you should see that it has generated a secret key. You will need this to add to your heroku config vars.
6. Head over to your app in heroku and navigate to the config vars section under settings. You will need the secret key you just generated for your webhook, in addition to your Publishable key and secret key that you can find in the API keys section back in stripe.
7. Add these values under these keys:  
    ```
    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = 'insert your stripe publishable key'
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = 'insert your secret key'
    STRIPE_WH_SECRET = 'insert your webhooks secret key'
    ```
8. Finally, back in your setting.py file in django, insert the following near the bottom of the file:  
    ```
    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = os.getenv('STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY', '')
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', '')
    STRIPE_WH_SECRET = os.getenv('STRIPE_WH_SECRET', '')
    ```
