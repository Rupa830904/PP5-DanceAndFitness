### Surface<hr>

#### Fonts
* The fonts I used for this site were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/):<br>
**Body:** *Alice, serif*<br>
**Logo:** *Yesteryear, cursive*<br>
**Custom error page:** *Josefin Sans, sans-serif*

## Business Model

* The business model chosen for this project is <b>Business to Customer</b>, as the main purpose of the website is to deliver final products to customers. This model was implemented using an interactive, attractive and intuitive interface that gives the clients an upgraded experience for shopping.<br><br>
<img src="media/b2c_diagram.png" width="60%">

* The DanceAndFitness center offers a diverse selections of dance and fitness packages categorised as *All Products*, *Dance* (Dances are further sub-categorised to Indian, western, and Fitness), *Training* (Trainings are further sub-categorised to GYM, Sports, and group trainings), *Recharge* (Reacharge are further sub-categorised to Food and Relax package).


## Marketing

### Facebook Page
* The marketing strategy includes a Facebook business page that is intended to create a good image of the bakeshop by posting news and promotions available. By highly promoting the products and always adding new content, the page will increase its popularity and attract more and more customers to buy from the online store. The page can be accessed at [this link](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61553025716191).<br><br><br>
*Note, this link may be broken as facebook regularly deletes inactive business pages.
<img width="80%" src="media/facebook_screenshot.png">

## Search Engine Optimisation

I have created a sitemap and robots.txt file to help aid search engines locate the site. To keep user's information safe, any pages that could contain sensitive information has been disallowed in the robots.txt.

The purpose of the About Us page was not so much designed in mind to inform the user, but more so to have an opportunity to use some keywords, and link the user to any other relevant website, all to help boost the site's ranking in search engine results.

The initial keywords and phrases I came up with were:<br>
### Short Tail Keywords
 * Indian Dance
 * Street Dance
 * Modern Dance
 * GYM
 * Fitness
 * Healthy Eating
 * Spa
 * Massages
 * Group Training
 * Zumba
 * Aerobics
 * Naturopathy
 * Badminton <br>

### Long Tail Keywords
 * Dance and Fitness
 * Health Packages
 * Happy Health Happy Life
 * Stay Healthy

## Agile Methodology
This project was developed utilising the Agile Methodogy.<br>
I prioritized features by labeling them such as "must-have", "could-have", "should have", and moved some less critical ones to future development. To guide my development process, I created user stories. These stories helped to define the features and functionalities that were most important to project's target audience.

As a student solo developer who was learning a lot during development, I faced challenges in estimating the time required for each task and only had a basic concept of what I would be able to create at a given timeframe. Therefore, I kept things simple and focused on achievable goals. Aiming for Minimum Viable Product, or MVP. All the features and functionalities that I wanted to have but I didn't manage to finish because of time constraints were moved to "Future Enhancement". With the goal of implementing them on the projects future release.

To keep track of progress, I used Github Projects(). I used a kanban board () divided into following sections: "to do", "in progress" "done" that allowed me to visualize all tasks and prioritize next steps. However, I could not find the "epics" feature in GitHub Projects, only milestones it provides only [milestones and issues](). Epics are supposed to be larger in scope than milestones, representing a significant amount of work. Milestones, on the other hand, are meant to mark significant points in time in terms of project completion. In this document, I added as epics, but on the project board, I used only [milestones]() to stay in order with GitHub's features.

By using Agile methodology, I was able to stay organized, work efficiently and focused on delivering the most important features, while also allowing flexibility for future development. This experience gave me invaluable insight and lessons that I can apply to future projects.

## Django secret key

In order to protect django app secret key it was set as anviroment variable and stored in env.py. Please change your password accordingly.

```python
os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "yourSecretKey"
```

## GitHub and Gitpod

Note: Repository was created using Code Institute template: [https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)

    ```

9. App can be run in gitpod enviroment using terminal command:

    ```text
    python3 manage.py runserver
    ```

10. Go to Heroku and follow further instructions below.


### Deploy on Heroku

## Heroku

1. Navigate to [https://heroku.com/](https://heroku.com/) login to your account and open dashboard. Click button "New" and select "Create new app" button.

2. Enter app name, I used "danceandfitness", chose your region and click on "Create app" button.

3. Click on newly created app and go to "Deploy" tab and then to "Deployment method" section. Authorize and connect your GitHub account, then find and select your repository.

4. Go to the "Settings" tab, click on "Reveal Config Vars" and add the following keys and values (all values should be strings without any quotation marks):

NOTE: DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC variable should be set to "1" for initial deployment. Before final deployment it should be removed.

    | Key                    | Value                                                            |
    |------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | CLOUDINARY_URL         | Cloudinary Url with access key                    |
    | DATABASE_URL           | postgress url beginning with postgress://                        |
    | DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC  | 1                                                                |                                                          |
    | SECRET_KEY             | YourSecretKey, the same as in env.py                             |


5. Return to your Gitpod workspace and navigate to the file `danceandfitness.settings.py`. Change allowed hosts including the name of the app that you created in previous steps. Save the file.

6. Procfile required to run project on Heroku was already created but if you change your app's name please make sure that this change is reflected in Procfile. It can be found in your project's main directory. In my case Procfile looks as below:

    ```python
    web: gunicorn danceandfitness.wsgi
    ```

7. After adding enviromental variables and editing Procfile project is ready for deployment. In Heroku app's dashboard navigate to "Deploy" tab, scroll down to "Manual deploy" section. Select main branch from dropdown menu and click on "Deploy Branch".

8. **Step required for final deployment:** Navigate again to app's settings, reveal config vars and delete DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC entry if it was set before.

9. After build is done, you should be able to see the button with the link leading to deployed app. In my case [Live Link](https://dancenfitness-708b83044c2d.herokuapp.com/).

### Stripe

Stripe is needed to handle the checkout process when a payment is made. You will need a stripe account which you can sign up for [here](https://stripe.com/en-gb).

#### Payments

1. To set up stripe payments you can follow their guide [here](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment#web-collect-card-details).

#### Webhooks

1. To set up a webhook, sign into your stripe account and click 'Developers' located in the top right of the navbar.
2. Then in the side-nav under the Developers title, click on 'Webhooks', then 'Add endpoint'.
3. On the next page you will need to input the link to your heroku app followed by /checkout/wh/. It should look something like this:  
    ```
    https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/
    ```
4. Then click '+ Select events' and check the 'Select all events' checkbox at the top before clicking 'Add events' at the bottom. Once this is done finish the form by clicking 'Add endpoint'.
5. Your webhook is now created and you should see that it has generated a secret key. You will need this to add to your heroku config vars.
6. Head over to your app in heroku and navigate to the config vars section under settings. You will need the secret key you just generated for your webhook, in addition to your Publishable key and secret key that you can find in the API keys section back in stripe.
7. Add these values under these keys:  
    ```
    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = 'insert your stripe publishable key'
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = 'insert your secret key'
    STRIPE_WH_SECRET = 'insert your webhooks secret key'
    ```
8. Finally, back in your setting.py file in django, insert the following near the bottom of the file:  
    ```
    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = os.getenv('STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY', '')
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', '')
    STRIPE_WH_SECRET = os.getenv('STRIPE_WH_SECRET', '')
    ```
